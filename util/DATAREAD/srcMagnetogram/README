How to create input magnetogram files for the SWMF from a
raw magnetogram fits file:

These are the steps for creating a magnetogram file for SWMF from 
any raw magnetogram fits file.

The steps below require IDL or python (includling astropy)
to be installed on your machine.

1. If the SWMF is already installed and compiled, skip to step 2. Otherwise,
   in the main SWMF path, type:

    ./Config.pl -install
    make

   To test if the codes work try:

   cd util/DATAREAD/srcMagnetogram
   make test_harmonics
   make test_fdips

   The resulting test_harmonics.diff and test_fdips.diff files should be empty.

2. In the directory SWMF_path/util/DATAREAD/srcMagnetogram
   compile the HARMONICS.exe and/or FDIPS.exe executables:

	make HARMONICS
        make FDIPS

3. Convert the raw magnetogram file from FITS to ASCII format. 
   There are two ways to do this:

3a. Run the python script 

   ./remap_magnetogram.py your_magnetogram_file.fits output_file.dat

3b. Use IDL to convert. Rename your magnetogram file and run the scripts

   cp your_magnetoram_file.fits fitsfile.fits
   idl run_fits_to_ascii.pro

   The idl routine generates four files:

	fitsfile.dat - obsolete ASCII file that was used by 
                       HARMONICS.exe and FDIPS.exe 
	fitsfile.H - the header of the original fits file with information 
                     about the magnetogram source.
	fitsfile_tec.dat - a Tecplot file to display the original magnetogram.

        fitsfile_idl.out - the new ASCII file format to be used by 
                           HARMONICS.exe or FDIPS.exe

4. Create and edit the input file HARMONICS.in and/or FDIPS.in:

   cp HARMONICS.in.orig HARMONICS.in
   emacs HARMONICS.in

   cp FDIPIS.in.orig FDIPS.in
   emacs FDIPS.in

   The original input files contain the documentation about all options.

5. Run the executables HARMONICS.exe and/or FDIPS.exe

   ./HARMONICS.exe

   mpirun -np 4 ./FDIPS.exe

6. Combine the FDIPS output files (1 per processor) into a single file 
   with the redistribute.pl script, for example

   ./redistribute.pl fdips_field_np010202.out fdips.out

7. Move the output file to the location where it is expected by the
   #MAGNETOGRAM  and/or #READPOTENTIALFIELD commands in the PARAM.in file.
